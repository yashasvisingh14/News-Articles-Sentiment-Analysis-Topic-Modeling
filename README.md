# News Articles Sentiment Analysis & Topic Modelling
## Overview of Project
Throughout history, news plays an important role in our daily life. People obtain information
through various media and news sites and get to know topics they are interested in or notable
information that they need to pay attention to. New media companies focus on delivering news to
either the general public or the target public. In our project, I got data from three new sites
which are Breitbart News, Fox News, and Newsmax. All three news media companies deliver
their news to the same target public. Fox News is one of the biggest news media companies in
the United States. Breitbart and Newsmax are smaller companies compared to Fox News. We are
interested in how these news sites shift main topics over time and the similarities or differences
in topic selection during the same period of time for these three news media companies since
they target the same audiences.

The goals of our project are mainly divided into five parts, which are data gathering,
data-preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.
